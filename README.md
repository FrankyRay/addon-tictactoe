# Tic Tac Toe Addon Minigames
Want to play Tic Tac Toe on your Minecraft World? Well, this addon is your answer.

I create Tic Tac Toe using Addon (Especially Minecraft Function) to make it easy to use and play (And I'm boring too). This pack is free from lag (maybe) and simple to use

## How I can play the Tic Tac Toe?
Easy and simple
1. Summon armor stand, you can by simply spawn with armor stand item or using `/summon armor_stand`
2. Name the Armor Stand "TicTacToe" with Name Tag or simply `/summon armor_stand TicTacToe`
3. Run the function `/function install` to show the board

You need to learn some command
1. `/function install` - To show the board
2. `/function start` - To start the game and choose who play first
3. `/function reset` - If the game is finish, or you choose the wrong tile, you can reset it and play again. You need to manually `/function start` to play again
4. `/function uninstall` - To delete the board and back to normal

## Warning!
Read this warning!
1. This addon using scoreboard, tag, and Armor Stand (It won't make lag, because it only uses a little)
2. Delete any tags will make the game broken
3. Delete any armor stand, it will make the game unplayable or something wrong
4. Deleting the leaderboard is fine, but deleting the main scoreboard will make the game unplayable or something wrong
